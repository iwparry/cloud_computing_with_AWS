# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Amazon EKS is a fully-managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the process of building, securing, operating, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters on AWS and on-premises data centres. EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so existing applications that run on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with EKS.

EKS lets you run your Kubernetes applications on both EC2 and AWS Fargate. EKS also integrates with core AWS services such as CloudWatch, Auto Scaling Groups to provide a seamless experience for monitoring, scaling and load balancing your containerised applications.
