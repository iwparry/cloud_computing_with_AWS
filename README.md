## Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx is the cost of long-term investments, usually assest expected to last beyond the current year. Examples of CapEx are land, buildings, IT eqipment etc. These are typically paid for upfront in large sums of cash that are tied up long-term with a gradual ROI over the lifecycle of the asset. Another challenge that comes with CapEx is that ownership & responsibility is transferred to the buyer, this means that the buyer is responsible for maintaining the asset, and cannot easily get rid of the asset should it not be able to provide the expected benefits or is becoming a burden. Although the typically longer lifecycle can be a positive if the asset provides a good ROI.

OpEx is the cost of day-to-day operations. Examples of these include subscriptions, wages, marketing, property leaisng such as IT infrastructure on AWS etc. These are typically funded on a pay-as-you-go basis in relatively smaller sums of ongoing payments (monthly, etc.). OpEx allows for flexibility of investment as it does not trap the investor long-term like with CapEx, and because the responsibility of maintaining the products, lie with the vendor (a cloud provider).
